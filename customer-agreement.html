							<h4>12. Risks Aknowledgement</h4>
							<p>
								The Customer acknowledges that in leveraged transactions are speculative, involve a high degree of risk, and is appropriate only for persons who can assume risk of loss of their margin deposit. The Customer understands that because of the low margin normally required in trading FX contracts, price changes in FX contracts may result in the loss of the Customer's margin deposit. The Customer warrants that the Customer is willing and able, financially and otherwise, to assume the risk of FX contracts trading, and in consideration of Comet FX carrying his/her account(s), the Customer agrees not to hold Comet FX responsible for losses incurred through following any information received from Comet FX or those of its employees, agents or representatives. The Customer recognizes that guarantees of profit or freedom from loss are impossible performances in foreign exchange contracts trading. The Customer acknowledges that the Customer has received no such guarantees from Comet FX or from any of its representatives or any introducing agent or other entity with whom the Customer is conducting his/her Comet FX account and has not entered into this agreement in consideration of or in reliance upon any such guarantees or similar representations.
							</p>
							<p>
								If the Customer directs Comet FX to enter into any FX contracts: (a) any profit or loss arising as a result of a fluctuation in the exchange rate affecting such currency will be entirely for the Customer's account and risk; (b) all initial and subsequent deposits for margin purposes shall be made in USD, or any other currency which Comet FX may choose to accept, in such amounts as Comet FX may in its sole discretion require, with subsequent deposits being in the same currency as the initial deposit; and (c) Comet FX is authorized to convert funds in Customer's account for margin into and from such foreign currency at a rate of exchange determined by Comet FX in its sole discretion on the basis of the then prevailing money market rates.
							</p>
							<p>
								Foreign exchange trading can involve a high degree of volatility which may result in substantial movements in the level of the Customer’s multi-currency exposure, possibly leading to significant losses. The risk that the value of Customer’s open positions may change even though trading for the relevant financial instrument is not available and the Customer is not able to open or close a position until trading reopens. This may result in suffering a financial loss or a lost opportunity to trade.
							</p>
							<p>
								Execution risk (delays in execution): the risk that an execution the Customer places is delayed or not executed due to a delay in transmission of data between Customer’s trading platform and Comet FX's servers (see System Risk). This may result in the available price the Customer had placed an order at no longer being available. As the Customer will generally be accessing the trading platform over a third party Internet service provider there is a risk that this may be caused by the Customer’s computer not maintaining a constant connection with the Comet FX servers.
							</p>
							<p>
								Systems risk: the operational systems risk inherent in online trading systems apply to every trade placed. This includes disruptions to communications, IT systems, software or hardware errors or other events that delay, interrupt or otherwise effect our systems operation. In the event such a disruption to the system does occur, the Customer may suffer a financial loss or loss of opportunity. In accordance with this Agreement and relevant Terms of Business, Comet FX makes no warranties and is not liable in relation to the operation of the trading platform or any other related service offered by Comet FX except to the case when disruption is caused by the fraud or dishonesty on the part of Comet FX or its employees, agents or representatives.
							</p>
							<p>
								The Customer is responsible for the ongoing maintenance of multi-currency exposure which may exposure the Customer to increased risks of losses and may lead to significant losses. The Customer agrees to not hold Comet FX liable for any losses incurred as a consequence of Comet FX maintaining such multi-currency exposure in the Customer’s account.
							</p>
							<p>
								The Customer acknowledges that market regulations and/or a significant imbalance of supply and demand, or a lack of liquidity may result in the temporary inability to buy or sell orders. This may result in the Customer holding positions for longer than desire or having to liquidate due to insufficient margin, which may result in losses up to or in excess of deposits.
							</p>
							<p>
								The Customer and Comet FX agree to comply with all rules, regulations, general practices and any other guidelines in force on relevant marketplaces and with counterparties Comet FX may operate.
