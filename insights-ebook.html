											Fundamental analysis is a way of looking at the market by analysing economic, social, and political forces that affects the supply and demand of an asset. The idea behind this type of analysis is that if a country's current or future economic outlook is good, their currency should strengthen. If demand for a country’s goods or services is increasing, or the number of people wanting to invest there is growing, they need to buy that country’s currency before they can buy its goods or invest and then the currency tends to rise in value. 
										</p>

											Investment in Australia, for example, is attractive when our economy is strong, when share prices on the stock market are expected to move higher, when companies are paying good dividends, and when interest rates are rising. When these things are happening, the Australian dollar tends to move higher against other currencies. The Australian dollar is like a tiny share in the wealth of the nation as a whole. Some of the economic indicators that show how healthy the economy is include: 
										</p>

										<ul>
											<li>
												Interest rates - the dollar tends to move up when interest rates are rising. 
											</li>
											<li>
												Global growth and demand for resources - Australia produces commodities including metals, coal and agricultural products such as wheat and wool. When demand for these goods is increasing, this supports the currency. 
											</li>
											<li>
												The economic cycle - Indicators include housing statistics, retail sales, automotive sales figures and employment levels.
											</li>
											<li>
												Budget and trade deficits and surpluses - surpluses indicate strong growth and a rising Australian dollar, deficits the opposite.
											</li>
											<li>
												Inflation – inflation reduces investment returns, and rising inflation tends to reduce the long- term value of the currency. Indicators of inflation include the consumer price index and the money supply statistics.

											Fundamental analysis is a way of looking at the market by analysing economic, social, and political forces that affects the supply and demand of an asset. The idea behind this type of analysis is that if a country's current or future economic outlook is good, their currency should strengthen. If demand for a country’s goods or services is increasing, or the number of people wanting to invest there is growing, they need to buy that country’s currency before they can buy its goods or invest and then the currency tends to rise in value.

											Investment in Australia, for example, is attractive when our economy is strong, when share prices on the stock market are expected to move higher, when companies are paying good dividends, and when interest rates are rising. When these things are happening, the Australian dollar tends to move higher against other currencies. The Australian dollar is like a tiny share in the wealth of the nation as a whole. Some of the economic indicators that show how healthy the economy is include: 
										</p>

										<ul>
											<li>
												Interest rates - the dollar tends to move up when interest rates are rising. 
											</li>
											<li>
												Global growth and demand for resources - Australia produces commodities including metals, coal and agricultural products such as wheat and wool. When demand for these goods is increasing, this supports the currency. 
											</li>
											<li>
												The economic cycle - Indicators include housing statistics, retail sales, automotive sales figures and employment levels.
											</li>
											<li>
												Budget and trade deficits and surpluses - surpluses indicate strong growth and a rising Australian dollar, deficits the opposite.
											</li>
											<li>
												Inflation – inflation reduces investment returns, and rising inflation tends to reduce the long- term value of the currency. Indicators of inflation include the consumer price index and the money supply statistics.
