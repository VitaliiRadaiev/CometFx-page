							</p>

							</p>

							<h4>Reasons We Share Your Personal Information </h4>
							<p>
								
								We share your personal information with your consent or as necessary to complete any transaction or provide any service you have requested or authorized (debiting and crediting your accounts, executing your trading orders, providing support to you etc.).	
							</p>
							<p>
								
								In order to provide you with our services we share your personal information with our partners, vendors and service providers, including IT and software providers and vendors. We may also share your personal information with third persons and authorities if required by law, in respond to legal process, to protect our clients, to maintain the security of our services and to protect the rights or property of Comet FX.	
							</p>
							<p>
								
								We do not sell, license, lease or otherwise disclose your personal information to any third party for any reason, except as described below.	
							</p>
							<p>
								
								We reserve the right to disclose your personal information to third parties when required to do so by law to regulatory, law enforcement or other government authorities. We may also disclose your information as necessary to credit reporting or collection agencies. We may also disclose your information to non-affiliated third parties if it is necessary to protect Comet FX rights or property.	
							</p>
							<p>
								
								We share your personal information with the banks and payment institutions, which process your payments to/from us. Commonly, we share your name, address, contact details (email) and the amount of payment to/from you. Such disclosure is made solely to provide you with an ability to deposit withdraw funds to/from us.	We may share your personal information with third parties acting as our liquidity providers. Once we hedge your positions with external liquidity providers they may access the information regarding your trading orders, including types of derivatives traded, their amount.	
							</p>
							<p>
								
								Your personal information may be shared with our software vendors and IT services providers including trading platform providers (hereinafter – “IT vendors”). While providing Comet FX with software, its modifications, implementation and support IT vendors may have an access to our information systems from their systems and locations. As a result, some of your personal information depending on the system where they are kept may be disclosed to our IT vendors. We limit an access of such IT vendors to our information systems to the best of our abilities. However, the situation may arise that in the process of software maintenance (modification of software functionality, migrating information to the new software versions, fixing bugs etc.) the vendor and/or IT provider get an access to the databases where your personal information is stored.	
							</p>
							<p>
								
								Some of IT vendors act as our technology providers based on the software-as-a-service (SAAS) business model. In this case, Comet FX use their information systems installed on their hardware environment. Respectively, our databases may be kept on the servers of such vendors. In this case, we limit an access using integrated management rules, which restrict vendor’s access to the information kept by its clients (Comet FX).	
							</p>
							<p>
								
								To help us improve our services to you, we may engage another business to help us to carry out certain internal functions such as account processing, client service and support, client satisfaction surveys or other information collection activities relevant to our business. We may also provide a party with customer information from our database to help us to analyze and identify customer’s needs and notify customers of product and service offerings. Use of the shared information is strictly limited to the performance of the task we request and for no other purpose.	
							</p>
							<p>
								
								We may share information with affiliates and partners, including companies operating under Comet FX ® brand name, if the information is required to provide the product or service you have requested, or to provide you with the opportunity to participate in the products or services our affiliates and  partners offer. We may also forge partnerships and alliances, which may include joint marketing agreements, with other companies who offer highquality products and services that might be of value to our customers. In order to ensure that these products and services meet your needs and are delivered in a manner that is useful and relevant, we may share some information with partners, affiliates and alliances. This allows them to better understand the offers that are most relevant and useful to yourself. The use of your personal information is limited to the purposes identified in our relationship with the partner or affiliate.	
							</p>
							<p>
								
								All third parties receiving your personal information from us under the respective agreements are required to protect your personal information in a manner similar to the way we do this. We use a variety of legal mechanisms, including contracts, to help insure your rights and protections. 
							</p>

							<h4>Restriction of Responsibility </h4>
							<p>
								If at any time you choose to purchase a product or service offered by another company, any personal information you share with that company will no longer be controlled under our Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for the privacy policies or the content of sites we link to and have no control of the use or protection of information provided by you or collected by those sites. Whenever you elect to link to a co-branded Web site or to a linked Web site, you may be asked to provide registration or other information. Please note that the information you are providing is going to a third party, and you should familiarize yourself with the privacy policy provided by that third party.
							</p>

								   ask how to gain access to it;	
								</li>
								<li>
									
								   be informed how to keep it up to date;

								   have inaccurate personal information corrected or removed;

								   to receive the personal information concerning them, which they have previously provided;	
								</li>
								<li>
									
								   prevent us from processing information or request that it is stopped if the processing of such information is likely to cause substantial, unwarranted damage or distress to the individual or anyone else, etc.;	
								</li>
								<li>
									
								   require us to ensure that no decision which significantly affects an individual is solely based on an automated process for the purposes of evaluating matters relating to him/her, such as conduct or performance;	
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p>

							</p>
							<h4>Security of Personal Information </h4>
							<p>
								
								We maintain strict security standards and procedures with a view to preventing unauthorized access to your information by anyone, including our staff.

							</p>
							<p>

							</p>

							<h4>Where Personal Information is Stored and Processed </h4>
							<p>
								Personal information collected by Comet FX may be stored and processed in your region or in any other country where Comet FX or its affiliates, subsidiaries or service providers maintain facilities.

We take steps to ensure that the information we collect under this privacy statement is processed according to the provisions of this statement and the requirements of applicable law wherever the information is located. 
							</p>

However, the period of your personal information retention can vary for different information types in the context of different products, actual retention periods can vary significantly. The criteria used to determine the retention periods include, for instance: 
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									
								   The	period	of	information	processing	needed	to	provide	the	services.	This	includes	such	things	as	maintaining	and	improving	the	performance	of	those	services,	keeping	our	systems	secure,	and	maintaining	appropriate	business	and	financial	records.	This	is	the	general	rule	that	establishes	the	baseline	for	most	information	retention	periods.	
								</li>
								<li>
									
								   The	information	subject's	consent	for	a	longer	retention	period.	If	so,	we	will	retain	information	in	accordance	with	the	consent.	
								</li>
								<li>
									
								   Comet	FX	is	subject	to	a	legal,	contractual,	or	similar	obligation	to	retain	the	information.	Mandatory	information	retention	laws	including	AML/CFT	regulations	can	be	applied	in	the	applicable	jurisdiction,	government	orders	to	preserve	information	relevant	to	an	investigation,	or	information	that	must	be	retained	for	the	purposes	of	litigation.	
								</li>
